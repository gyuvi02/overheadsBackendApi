This Spring Boot API is my hobby project running on a Tomcat Server on an Ubuntu cloud VPS. The goal of the project is to create a web application where tenants can record the values of their water, gas and electricity meters, even by attaching a photo. Each tenant has access only to the data of his/her own apartment, the administrator can add new apartments, users and edit them. The application sends a reminder to the tenants every month on a specific day per apartment. The application is able to generate a summary pdf file of the latest data and sends it to the tenant after approval by the administrator.
